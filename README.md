# A simple nonlocal back-projection unfolded network for pansharpening
Migars 2024 Fusion Net

## Abstract
Pansharpening is the fusion process that combines the geometry of a high-resolution panchromatic image with the
spectral information encoded in a low-resolution multispectral image. In this paper, we introduce a back-projection method
to minimize the reconstruction error between the target image and the output produced by the Brovey pansharpening model.
We replace the back-projection kernel with a residual network architecture that incorporates a nonlocal module,
exploiting self-similarity in satellite images and built upon the multi-head attention mechanism.
Experimental validation on the Pelican dataset showcases that our method achieves state-of-the-art results.

## Usage example
Set classes in `config.py` for default values. Pass params to the `main.py` as string or key=value see example
```bash
python train --model GPPNN --model-params hyper_channels=4 --dataset-params scaling=4
```
To test new datasets (see StMichel as example):
1. Add `<new class>.py` to dataset directory
2. Add new class to `src/dataset/__init__.py`'s dict_dataset
3. Inputs and outputs should be dicts


To test new model (see NLBPUN as example):
1. Add `<new class>.py` to model directory
2. Add new class to `src/model/__init__.py`'s dict_model
3. Inputs and outputs should be dicts


Add an `.env` file in the project's root path with the following env-variables
```ini
DATASET_PATH="" # path to find all de datasets
SAVE_PATH="" # path to save tensorboard data
EVAL_FREQ=100  # % frequency to print to tensorboard
```
## SOTA
In this project we have compared our code with [MDCUN](https://github.com/yggame/MDCUN),
[NLRNet](https://github.com/Ding-Liu/NLRN) and [GPPNN](https://github.com/shuangxu96/GPPNN). 
And we get the classic methods from [Classic Methods](https://github.com/codegaj/py_pansharpening)
